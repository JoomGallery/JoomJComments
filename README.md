# JoomJComments
This module integrates the comment component JComments into JoomGallery. So JComments has to be installed on your site in order to use this module. JComments is a very feature rich comment system and offers much more convenience than JoomGallery's own comment system. With this module it is also possible to comment on categories not only images.
